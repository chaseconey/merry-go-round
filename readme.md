## merry-go-round

merry-go-round is a very simple application that assists in tracking and routing calls to be transferred/distributed to
a set of individuals (receivers). It doesn't use any advanced algorithms or fancy formulas, it simply grabs the first
receiver that has the least number of received calls. You also have the ability to skip to the next receiver and it
will grab the next person with the least number of received calls. Pretty simple, eh?

## Features

* User Auth
* Add call meta information anywhere in application
* Links all calls to the received party automatically
* Logs who creates said calls
* Dynamically add any set of receivers
